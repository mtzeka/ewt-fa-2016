          <h2>General</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Everything must be typed and coded by you. You may use online resources and class work as reference but at the end of the day you are to use that as learning material and required to come up with your own solution.</li>
            <li>Libraries are okay to use because we never claim them as our own work. They are tools that help us make our life easier.</li>
            <li>All code must be commented and given explanation by the author (you).</li>
            <li>Giving away code is a facilitation of plagiarism.</li>
            <li>If you're stuck please email me. Must use your loop email.</li>
            <li>Be nice, listen, think. Help each other learn.</li>
            <li>If anything offense comes up, talk to me privately.</li>

          <h2>Browsers</h2>
          <p>
            Almost everything we do in this class will work in both
            <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome">Chrome</a>
            and <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox">Firefox</a>.
            Both of these browsers have great standards support and wonderful dev tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before you launch a real-deal web thing, you'd better test it in the other
            major browsers as well:
            <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_%28web_browser%29">Safari</a>
            and <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer">IE</a>
            (and now <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Edge">Edge</a> I
            guess too?).

          <h2>Text Editors</h2>
          <p>
            The most critical tool when it comes to building websites is your text editor.
            You're not going to be very productive without being able to write code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the most common text editors are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a rel="external" href="http://atom.io/">Atom</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a rel="external" href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a rel="external" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a rel="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29">Vim</a>
            </li>

          <h2>Using Github for class</h2>
          <p>
            You are required to get a github account up and running in case you don't already have one. Create a repository dedicated to this class and all your classwork and homework will be uploaded as a new folder in that repository. You will then link to it from your index class file.
          </p>
          <p>All your work should follow the following directory structure:<p/>
          <p class="code">
            /css<br/>
            -- main.css<br/>
            -- [name].css<br/>
            /js<br/>
            -- script.js<br/>
            -- [name].js<br/>
            /index.html<br/>
          </p>
