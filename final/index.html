          <h2>Your turn to teach the class something new!</h2>
          <p>You will pick a technical topic in web development to research and give the class an 8-10 minute presentation on the topic. Your presentation will include demos, code snippets, and references to all your sources.</p>
          <p>You CANNOT talk about something we've already talked about in class. Unless you plan to cover more advanced material on a topic that's already been discussed.</li>
          <p>
            Ideas:
            <ul>
              <li>SCSS v.s. LESS</li>
              <li>Lodash v.s. underscore</li>
              <li>React v.s. Angular (or backbone, ember, vue)</li>
              <li>React Native</li>
              <li>React Router</li>
              <li>Gulp v.s. Grunt v.s. Webpack</li>
              <li>Package managers - NPM, Bower, Homebrew</li>
              <li>Compare different text editors and their capabilities</li>
              <li>Compare sorting algorithms and their performance</li>
              <li>Advanced Github workflow</li>
              <li>Advanced SCSS usage</li>
              <li>Socket.io</li>
              <li>WebGL</li>
              <li>Service workers</li>
              <li>Data scraping</li>
              <li>A framework we haven't talked about</li>
              <li>Tell us about an API you tried using</li>
              <li>A guide to using an open source JS or CSS library</li>
              <li>Something in MDN we haven't talked about yet</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>This is just a list to get you started. Choose any topic on the list or anything you come up with on your own.</p>
