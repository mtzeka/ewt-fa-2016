          <p>"Hunter Loftis is responsible for the Node.js platform at Heroku. When he’s not working at Heroku, he runs PlayfulJS, a website of cool JavaScript code snippets.</p>
          <p>One of the better well-known demos on PlayfulJS is a re-creation of the Doom rendering engine in JavaScript. After building this, Hunter was contacted by Warp records about building a first-person shooter in JavaScript.</p>
          <p>One of the issues with this request was the timeframe — three weeks to build the game to coincide with an album release, and with a tiny budget. On top of that, the game had to work on desktop, Android, and iOS. So, Hunter rationalized and decided to accept the project.</p>
          <p>After accepting the project for what he thought would be a small, indie release, Hunter realized that the artist (Rustie) was huge in the UK and overseas, and this release would be a huge deal."</p>

          <p>Oscar®-nominated documentarian Werner Herzog (Grizzly Man, Cave of Forgotten Dreams) chronicles the virtual world from its origins to its outermost reaches, exploring the digital landscape with the same curiosity and imagination he previously trained on earthly destinations. Herzog leads viewers on a journey through a series of provocative conversations that reveal the ways in which the online world has transformed how virtually everything in the real world works - from business to education, space travel to healthcare, and the very heart of how we conduct our personal relationships.</p>
